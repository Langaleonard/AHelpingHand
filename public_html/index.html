        <p><font size="4px">It has come to our attention that children are more of an investment and especially to a country's growth.
           we have to focus on building them and guiding them in order to help them become the best they can be as individuals
           and citizens of our beloved country. As the A Helping Hand NGO our aim is to help children strive to get quality education, 
           access to the right nutrition and provide health care.

                           Having an infant is the most beautiful thing in the world but the only problem is raising the child. Few parents are assisted by the government with social grant to sustain their families but unfortunately the remaining are left neglected and not taken care of. 
                       </p>
                       <p>
                           We have organized a group of willing women to go out of their way to look after children who are coming from poor communities, we go to their school to give food, clothing, moral support and encouragement.
