                It was founded in 2001 by Leonardo Junior Langa whose aim was to minimize child abuse and inequality in underprivileged communities.
We mainly assess and explore poor communities then we see how we can become of great use or help to them. Education, health, and child protection is what we investigate.
We interact with children, and we provide protection because there are high levels of violence against women and children, many cases go unreported and people live normally in silence. We have also realized that victims get affected at a later stage in life and that’s the reason why we find a lot of teenagers out of school, abusing drugs and harmful substances to their lives, they end up being involved in crimes and some have mental disorder because violence has a long-lasting effect on one’s mental health. 
<br> </p>
        
<p>
Some communities have high rate of drop out because the children have difficulties to get to school, some factors are that the school fees are high, they go to school hungry and that affects their academic performances and because of certain commitments at home, they end up believing that school is useless and that’s where we come in to encourage such learners.
Communities are affected deeply by unemployment and some folks are uneducated that is the reason why poverty is on strike. With giving children hope and giving them quality education and aligning them with the right foundation they will have a poverty free and more equal society.
Education –
 is the most significant tool/key to success, it is a weapon against poverty, and it has power to transform children’s lives regardless of where they come from. We also focus on making sure that the learning facilities are in good conditions.
Food-
With kids having healthy food and eating well, they are enabled to reach their full potential.

Our objective is to support children who that involved in abuse and to also develop new methods of fighting all forms of harassment experienced at home. Monitor odd behaviour of children that would somehow show oppression and help them so their voices can be heard and also promote positive discipline in their homes and at school.
