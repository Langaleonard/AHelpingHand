We encourage children to become responsible.
We nurture children’s interest  based on the choices and make learning fun. Give alternates to the schools we visit to approach teaching differently in customizable ways so that children can enjoy being in schools.
Teach the children their rights and how they should be properly brought up. Arrange parents meetings so that they can assist their kids leaning and inspire them to think independently and be more receptive.
We provide clothing with the help of other organizations such as Jupiter Clothes and the government.
We also give away food to schools such as Sedibeng primary school, and travel around townships and villages to contribute child care and protection. </p>
